# CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of projects completed as part of Harvard's **CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python** course. This repository contains 12 projects demonstrating a variety of AI and machine learning concepts, from search algorithms and knowledge representation to neural networks and natural language processing.

## Certification

I earned my certification in **AI with Python** through both **Harvard** and **edX**:

- [Harvard Certificate](https://certificates.cs50.io/8fe6f96d-95f8-4e61-9834-2790a3f5d25d.pdf?size=letter)
- [edX Verified Certificate](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/1b144ba229404f66b825a646ad97230b)

You can view my course progress and grades in the official [CS50 AI Gradebook](https://submit.cs50.io/users/becks256/ai50/projects/2024).

## Project List

The following are the 12 projects I completed during the course:

### 1. Search
* [**Degrees of Separation**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/0/degrees/) – Finding the shortest path between actors using breadth-first search.
* [**Tic-Tac-Toe**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/0/tictactoe/) – Implementing an AI that plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm.

### 2. Knowledge
* [**Knight's Logic Puzzle**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/1/knights/) – Encoding logic puzzles as knowledgebases and using propositional logic to infer solutions.
* [**Minesweeper**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/1/minesweeper/) – Creating an intelligent Minesweeper player using probability and logical inference.

### 3. Uncertainty
* [**PageRank**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/2/pagerank/) – Simulating the PageRank algorithm used by search engines.
* [**Heredity**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/2/heredity/) – Using Bayesian networks to model gene inheritance.

### 4. Optimization
* [**Crossword**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/3/crossword/) – Solving crossword puzzles using backtracking and arc-consistency.

### 5. Learning
* [**Shopping**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/4/shopping/) – Predicting whether online shoppers will complete a purchase using machine learning techniques.
* [**Nim**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/4/nim/) – Building a reinforcement learning agent that plays the game of Nim.

### 6. Neural Networks
* [**Traffic**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/5/traffic/) – Using convolutional neural networks to identify German traffic signs.

### 7. Language
* [**Parser**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/6/parser/) – Building a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) parser for natural language.
* [**Attention**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/6/attention/) – Building an AI to predict a masked word in a text sequence.

## How to Use

Each project contains its own directory with the necessary Python files and any data used. To run any project, follow these steps:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some projects also require downloading additional assets from external sources, like the gtsrb dataset for the Traffic project.  Refer to the relavant project link above and download the appropriate assets noted in the project description. 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/becks256/cs50.git
   cd cs50
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project you want to explore:
    ```bash
    cd project-directory
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the project using Python:
    ```bash
    python project_file.py
    ```

## Technologies
* **Python:** All projects are implemented in Python.
* **Libraries:** Various projects make use of libraries such as `NumPy`, `TensorFlow`, `OpenCV`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, and `HuggingFace` depending on the requirements.
