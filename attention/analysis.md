## Layer 8, Head 10

This attention head seems to focus on understanding how words after "over" are connected. For example, when given a sentence like "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy [MASK]," it highlights the words "the," "lazy," and "[MASK]" together. This suggests that it’s helping the model figure out what typically follows the word "over" and how those words form a meaningful phrase.

Example Sentences: 
- The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy [MASK].
- The slow green turtle strolls past the raging [MASK].

## Layer 10, Head 8

This attention head seems to focus on figuring out relationships between important words in a sentence. For example, when given a sentence like "The bridge stretches over the [MASK] connecting the two cities," it focuses on connecting words like "bridge" and "over," as well as "[MASK]" and "connecting." This suggests that it’s helping the model understand how things are related when it comes to describing locations or connections.

Example Sentences:
- The bridge stretches over the [MASK] connecting the two cities.
- The tunnel goes under the [MASK] joining the two cities.
